# Pikasiili
Pikasiili was created to make managing and testing my Python projects easier. Of course it can be used for other kinds of projects too. In the program you can save your project folder and start up commands and then launch or edit the project with a press of a button.

Start by filling in the fields with your projects info and then press "Add project". Project info is stored in text files so they are easy to edit, they can be found in "userdata" folder where Pikasiili is installed. Pressing "Run" opens a new command line window that runs the project with the command.

Icon image was generated with DALL-E 3 and edited by hand afterwards, prompt is: "Simple vector art with black outline on a white background, purple hedgehog hugging a strawberry and looking happy, very simple art".
